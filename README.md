# pangovkvg

Source code of `pangocairo` taken from the [Pango repository](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pango) and currently being modified to use [`vkvg`](https://github.com/jpbruyere/vkvg) instead of [`cairo`](https://github.com/freedesktop/cairo).

## Notes

I am reimplementing few functions at a time, everything else is commented out. Currently it doesn't compile.

## License

Most of the code of Pango is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser Public License (LGPL) - see the file COPYING for details.
